                What could we possibly achieve by listening to motivational speeches? Isn’t that a waste of time? It’s
                not. A great motivational speech can be a trigger to action. It inspires you to do something. Powerful
                speeches make you realize you’re not just a useless individual in this world. Everyone matters. You
                matter, too.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Have you been feeling that inner drive to seek a higher purpose for a long time? If so, you need to take
                action. First, you need a trigger that will get you to that action. Try to think of an influential
                person. Let’s take an example: Jim Morrison. He was one of the most charismatic individuals of his time.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                “Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks
                and vanishes. You are free.” That’s only one of the many pieces of wisdom he gave to humanity. These are
                not only words. They shrink deep inside you. They make you think. They make you act.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Jim Morrison said that during an interview. Back then, motivational speeches were not a big thing. Now,
                great individuals are trying to make a difference through that specific method. Are you ready to start
                exploring the best motivational speeches that will make you act?</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                This is one of the most emotional and inspiring speeches you’ll ever listen to. Although Jobs presented
                it way before TED talks became popular, you’ll notice it has a similar flow to an inspiring TED talk. It
                is relatively short, it has a theme, and it proves a point through a story.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Through this speech, Jobs tells us how we can find triumph through struggle. Jobs gave this speech one
                year after he was diagnosed with cancer. He had surgery and he was fine at that point. That’s the most
                important part of this speech: understanding our time here is limited. What are we going to do with it?
                That’s what matters.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Have you seen the movie Any Given Sunday? It’s a great one. The moment when Al Pacino gives one of the
                greatest speeches seen on the big screen is priceless. It’s not just a speech about football. It’s about
                winning. It’s about overcoming obstacles. It’s about becoming stronger. It’s about life in general!
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                “… In either game life or football the margin for error is so small. I mean one-half step too late or
                too early you don’t quite make it. One-half second too slow or too fast and you don’t quite catch it.
                The inches we need are everywhere around us. They are in every break of the game, every minute, every
                second.” That’s only a part of this great speech. Funny enough, it starts with “I don’t know what to
                say, really.”

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                “I’ve been waiting more than 30 years to say this: ‘Dad, I always told you I’d come back and get my
                degree.’” That’s one of the funniest parts of this speech. Gates didn’t graduate. He is Harvard’s most
                successful dropout. He makes a big point, though: the fact that he dropped out doesn’t make academic
                life less of an important experience. Gates used to sit in on classes he hadn’t even signed up for.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                As he says in his speech, one of his most precious memories of Harvard is being in the midst of so much
                energy and intelligence. Education is important, and it is a privilege. However, getting to know the
                wider world is also important, even though it’s shocking for the most part.</p>
