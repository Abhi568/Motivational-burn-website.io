            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Motivational speech can come from anywhere or anyone, but it usually has a specific audience in mind.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Just like in sports, being motivated at work is crucial for your performance. This rings especially true
                when you have a looming deadline, an important meeting, or colleagues or customers depending on your
                performance.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                When we eagerly want something , our performance get increase more than even before but I m sure
                everyone got demotivated at least once in a life , at that how can anyone overcome from his/her
                depression and fear , Only one thing which helps us in that circumstances to get rid of , called
                Motivation

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Think about the last time felt generally unmotivated. What brought you out of that feeling? Sometimes
                all it takes is a good night's sleep or seeing the fruits of your labor to fire you up. Still other
                times, you might listen to someone say something that resonates with you -- that alters the way you've
                been looking at a particular task or problem.</p>

                family, they earn a living, and then they die. </p>

                That’s what we’re supposed to do, right? Wrong! Life is made for greater things, and you are meant for

                When Les Brown was a child, he was labeled ‘educable mentally retarded’, and until a chance encounter
                with another teacher, he believed that he would amount to nothing. But this one teacher planted the
                seeds in Les’ head which would blossom and grow, and eventually make him one of the best motivational
                speakers of all time.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                This speech will give you permission to rise above other people’s opinions, to break free of their
                prejudices, and make a success of whatever you do. Watch ‘It’s Not Over Until You Win! Your Dream is
                Possible’ and take those first steps towards following your passion and making your dream come true.</p>

                Life is about choices. Every day we’re faced with hundreds of choices, and this speech by Tony Robbins
                will help you see that it’s the choices, not the conditions, which shape our lives.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Take a moment during this speech to pause and reflect on some choices you have made in the past, and
                really think about the direction your life took because of them, both good and bad. Tony Robbins
                explains in his inimitable way that we have the choice to focus on what we want, and that when we focus,
                we can achieve whatever we want.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Part of Tony’s speech explains how, when the economy is down, some people thrive and some people crash
                and burn, and the COVID 19 pandemic is the perfect example. Small businesses took a huge hit, and while
                some of them threw up their hands in despair and said ‘that’s it, it’s over for us’, others adapted, and
                saw it as an opportunity to expand, diversify, and turn the situation to their advantage.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                And that’s the cornerstone of this video – how we react, how we adapt, and how we choose is the
                difference between success and failure.

                Be inspired by Arnold Schwarzenneger as he talks about his goal of becoming Mr. Universe. Never wasting
                a second of his day, Arnie worked in construction, spent 5 hours in the gym, and went to acting classes,
                all of which took him further along his journey to making his dream come true.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                We all have a propensity to waste time, but if you have a goal, if you have a passion that smolders
                away, take a leaf out of Arnie’s book and make sure that everything you do propels you forward.

                If you are a fan of The Secret, you will be familiar with Lisa Nicholls. In this video, Lisa tells Tom
                Bilyeu how she was willing to leave everything and everyone behind in order to grow into the version of
                herself that she knew she wanted.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Lisa explains how, as a young mother, she was forced to wrap her baby in a towel for two days because
                she had no money for diapers, and how it was at that moment that she vowed never to be that broke or
                that broken again.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Change, success, drive…they’re all inconvenient and disruptive, and Lisa Nicholls demonstrates that
                wonderfully in this emotional and highly motivating interview in which she declares “your story is not
                meant to be your fortress, your story is meant to be your fuel.”

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                This short piece by Tony Robbins has been designed to show you that you are in control of your own
                environment. Whether you realize it or not, what goes on around you has a massive influence on the way
                you feel and the way you act.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                By taking leadership of your own life, you can defy outside influences and set your own tone for the day
                ahead, regardless of whatever or whoever is exerting pressure from the outside.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Follow Tony’s example of taking 10 minutes for yourself at the start of every day – for gratitude,
                prayer or wishes for family and friends, and a recap of what you want to accomplish that day, and your
                day will continue on that same path of thankfulness, hope, and goals.
